**Text to Particle**

Simple particle to text effect powered by ImageRenderer. This is basically sampling pixel data and put dots in random position. And then slowly move them to original position as timer fires up. 

Inspired by some website that I saw the other day - got help from ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet 3.5
